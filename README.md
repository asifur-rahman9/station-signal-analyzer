# station-signal-analyzer
The Base Station Signal Analyzer is a Python-based project that processes and analyzes signal data from various base stations. The project uses JSON data files containing base station information and provides functionalities for visualizing, processing, and displaying signal statistics.


# Features
	•	Data Parsing: Reads and processes data from JSON files.
	•	Signal Analysis: Calculates and displays statistics such as signal strength and frequency ranges for antennas.
	•	Visualization: Displays heatmaps and graphical representations of signal coverage.
	•	Menu-Based Interaction: Offers a user-friendly interface to navigate through functionalities.
	•	Modular Design: Each functionality is implemented in separate Python scripts for better maintainability.
